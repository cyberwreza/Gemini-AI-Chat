# ESP32 Oscilloscope

This script turns your ESP32 microcontroller into a basic oscilloscope that displays waveforms on an SSD1306 128x64 I2C OLED display. It captures and visualizes analog signals, allowing you to view waveforms such as sine waves, PWM, or any other input from an analog source.

## Features
-Live analog signal display (static, not scrolling)
-Grid and axis for voltage/time reference
-Smoothed waveform drawing
-Optimized for ESP32 (12-bit ADC on pin 36)
